### Built With

- Vanilla JS
- CSS
- HTML

### Concepts and Ideas Learnt

- How to use **clip-path** in CSS.
- When considering font sizes I came accross [container queries](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Container_Queries) although ultimately decided they weren't the best solution in this instance.

- Safari has an issue with respecting z-index with some rotating items. I resolved it by wrapping the rotating item in another div as suggest [here.](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/20851452/z-index-is-canceled-by-setting-transformrotate)

### Areas to Improve

To further improve on this project I could:

- Allow users to enter a custom date to countdown until rather than a generic 14 days.
- Create a version for use in React.
